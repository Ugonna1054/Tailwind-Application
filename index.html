    <h3> Hi Adam,</h3>

    <p>
        <p>
            My name is Ugonna, a Software developer from Lagos, Nigeria.

            I am interested in this opportunity, even moreso i love the way you put together the Application webpage ;
            it's very encouraging :)
        </p>

        <p> I primarily do Vue.js as my main JS front-end framework, and have also used Material design, Bootstrap and
            Bootstrap-vue for my UIs in my web applications.</p>

        <p> On the backend, I do Node.js, I am full-stack and my development arsenal for now is the MEVN stack i.e
            MongoDB, Express, Vue and Node.</p>

        <p> Beyond my tech stack, I see myself as a very good problem solver (I use stackoverflow yess :) ) but
            sometimes stackoverflow will not give you the exact answer to your question, then you will have no choice
            but to think through the solution yourself or consult a more senior developer in the specific area of
            interest...</p>

        <p>I have built a mini real-time application with the MEVN and socket.io with only a tutorial video i watched,
            where they used REACT and Node as well as socket.io. I was able to implement what i learnt from the tutorial
            in my own application and even expanded on it and added other features i wanted to my own application....I
            am someone who's always up and thinking of ways to implement tasks, fix bugs, better ways to do things and
            so on. I literally think about a challenge while taking a shit, while going home on my way from work, inside
            the bus, literally anywhere :) until i get that problem fixed!!</p>

        <p>I am someone who BELIEVES! I do not know it all but i always want to give it a try, i always want to BEGIN
            and LEARN as i progress! I believe no one was born with all the programming knowledge, We have all learnt
            and are successful at our respective areas due to constant and consistent practice, dedication and
            commitment to our respective roles/ideas. I believe anything can be learned by anyone with the right
            mindset... I am one of such people and this is a reason why you should consider working with me; i share
            same values that you do, (i completed my schooling tho :) :) - the best student in my class) but I have/am
            building a career totally unrelated to what i studied in college and it's totally fine! The best decision i
            have made in my life till today!</p>

        <p>In the industry today, I like the very fact that you can achieve a desired goal with different stacks or
            Frameworks; we are not boxed into using one particular thing, and this i believe creates a healthy
            competition, room for more innovations and everyone is always on their toes to deliver their best and the
            developers, who use these Frameworks have the liberty and freedom to choose what they like and what works
            best for them.. </p>

        <p>Here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Kz-u1ZvENyTKIBmTn7QhtAlNVGXvWIQV">Link</a> to my CV on
            google drive. </p>

        <p> An opportunity is all i ask for and we both won't regret it ever! That i can promiseðŸ˜Š</p>

        <p>Thanks for your time!!</p>
    </p>
